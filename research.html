  When I was an academic, my focus was eighteenth century British social history,
  in particular The Grand Tour.
  <br>My Master's theis posited that 'in both the experience of
  the Grand Tour as lived by participants and the perception of the Tour at home
  it is possible to see the echoes of larger issues in eighteenth-century British
  society,particularly those of national identity, consumption, luxury and masculinity.'
