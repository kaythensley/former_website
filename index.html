  <center><h1> Teaching Myself All the Things</h1></center>
  <p> I've been making websites in one form or another for...a long time now.
    This site is my sandbox for everything web design related. With a little bit
    of luck it will eventually turn into a portfolio site with all kinds of cool
    things.</p>
  <p> For now, however, we're on the basics. Enjoy the ride! <p>
